# TODO

## DWM

 - [ ] Change quit function to execute the dmenu exit script (dont actually use bash script)

    Tag text, bottom centralized, hide vacant tags, toggle, option to show applications
    status text at top (hidden by default, toggle and hold capability), show clickable sys info
    Windows title, at windows top

    - [ ] Separate every bar piece
    - [ ] Tag bar at bottom
    - [ ] Status bar at top

    - [ ] Title bar:

 ### Theme  

  * Idea:
    Light/Dark theme, switch through keybind

  - [x] Solarized light/dark
  - [x] Function to switch
    * Idea: function to switch changes commands, keybinds, wallpaper, runs commands, runs functions, changes color scheme, all configurable inside config.h, so it must be able to take a argument and make all those functions
    - [ ] Able to switch theme
    - [ ] Able to switch spawn commands (for color maybe)
    - [ ] Able to run any number of functions (with arguments)
    - [ ] Able to run any number of commands (literally just spawn tho)


 ### Shortcuts & Widgets

## ST

 - [ ] Different color schemes (change through argument)
